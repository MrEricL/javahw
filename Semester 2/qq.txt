HW#07: Xiangâ€™s Troubles

2x2
	Impossible since a queen no matter where is the maximum
3x3
	See 2X2
4x4
	Seems to be only one solution (not counting reflection) since it default locks down on to one solution. All solutions thereafter are possible since 4 is, it simply adds a row and a column, and thus they all have at least one unique solution.
5x5
	2 solutions, since there are two ways new unique ways to fit the row/column to produce solution.
6x6
	1 solution since when the board becomes even, that means that the left/top most diagonal is connected to the right/bottom most and thus even when a row/column is added the even size board elminates it down to one.
7x7
	Empirically, at least 5 unique solutions.
8x8
	Applying the rule from before with the diagonals, every solution generates two more base on row/column placement so therefore there is at least 10 unique solutions.
