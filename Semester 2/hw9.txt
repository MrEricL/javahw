Knights Tour Algorithm 
1. Create nxn board
2. Place the knight at 0, 0
3. Make a knights move and continues to recurse
4. If it cannot make a knights move, try a different move
5. If it is unable to move for all, go back one and try different move
6. Repeat until all moves are exhuasted
5. Check to make sure all the board is filled

	| 1	|8 	|13|10|
	| 11|   | 4|7 |
	| 5	| 2	| 9	|12 |
	| 	| 	| 6	| 3  |
